This repository implements the Baum Welch algorithm in tensorflow
(assuming Normal dists for the observations for now).

To run the test code:
python create_fake_data.py
python practice_hmm.py

To run the method on the weather data:
python run_practice_baumwelch.py

Next steps are to add monitoring and make this more flexible.
